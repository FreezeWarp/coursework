# Coursework
This is a copy of all major programming coursework I've done as part of my degree. It includes the following classes:

  1. ICS 141, with basic Java programming assignments.
  2. ICS 225, with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assignments.
  3. ICS 240, which covered implementation of data structures like queues and linked lists.
  4. ICS 340, which covered algorithms; highlights here include an implementation of the [Held-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) for the [Travelling Salesperson Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), an implementation of [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) across a graph with an including visualisation of the solution using [GraphViz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/)
  5. ICS 372, which covered design patterns. The large group projects for that class can be found at [the repository for project 1](https://github.com/FreezeWarp/372Groupwork-Project1), and [the repository for project 2](https://github.com/FreezeWarp/372Groupwork-Project2).
  6. ICS 425, which covered Java EE MVC. In addition to the Java EE original, I [ported the final project for this class, an implementation of Reversi, to PHP/Laravel here](https://github.com/FreezeWarp/reversi).
